Current Issues with Hus Project. 

	ISSUE 1 - on V2 

	Can run my Minimax function with depth = 3 without any problems.  --> WIN all games in ~35 moves. 

	When I try and run my Minimax function with depth = 4, 6. 

	What i dont understand is that within HusBoardState this code is given:

		 /** Detect when a player has won. Called at the end of a turn. A player
		     * wins when their opponent is about to play but has no legal moves.*/
		    private void updateWinner(int next_to_play){

		        if(winner != NOBODY){
		            return;
		        }

		        if(!hasValidMoves(next_to_play)){
		            winner = (next_to_play + 1) % 2;
		            return;
		        }

		        if(turn_number > MAX_TURN){
		            winner = DRAW;
		        }
		    }

	How am i possibly running games that reach values greater than 5000 turns? Doesnt make any sense.
